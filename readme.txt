Adds a grid where you can use drag drop to manually change the sort order of your posts on the first page.

Version 2 will applay the grid changes direct on the default 'the_loop'. No need for template hacking.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a grid under "Posts" in the admin where you can use drag drop to sort and publish posts to the first page.

The "mounted" post will appear on top, so using this plugin your editors can controll exact whay to publish on the forst page.


**Why is this nice?**
So far the sorting is by date or you can use a sticky post, using "Content Sort" you can control all posts.
This creates a more CMS-like behaviour to Wordpress and gives you more controll.

== Installation ==

1. Drop into plugin folder
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
3. Done
